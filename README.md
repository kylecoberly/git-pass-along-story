# Git Pass Along Story

In a group of at least 3, write a collaborative story.

1. Choose someone in the group to fork this repository. **Only one person in the
   group should do this--everyone else should fork from that person's copy of
   the repo**. The person who does the initial fork will need to add the rest of
   the group as collaborators.
2. Write a byline on line 3 of `story.md` that includes all of your names. The
   first person to push has it easy; the next two will have to resolve merge
   conflicts to finish it. Communicate up front about what order you're going to
   commit in to make this easier!
3. **Start a new branch**. Write a conclusion to the sentence "It was a dark and
   stormy night" on line 3 of `story.md`. Push your **branch** to GitHub and
   pull request it back to `main`. As a group, use the discussion and feedback
   features to pick a conclusion to use for the rest of the story. Merge the PR
   into `main`, and have everyone in the group pull down the new changes.
4. Make a new branch **from your updated `main` branch**. Use the same process
   to complete the prompt `But then suddenly,` on line 7.
5. Make a new branch **from your updated `main` branch**. Use the same process
   to complete the prompt `Finally,` on line 9.
